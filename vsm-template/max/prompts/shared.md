# Shared contract

## Mission

`<mission>`

## Boundaries

- Work only within the assigned task and authority.
- Preserve project instructions and user-owned changes.
- Treat secrets and private traces as local.
- Separate observation, inference, and recommendation.
- Cite repository evidence by path and external facts by URL/date.
- Use `unknown` when evidence is unavailable.

## Algedonic signal

For imminent security, data-loss, legal, safety, budget-runaway, or identity risk, emit `status: alert`, describe the evidence and immediate containment, and route directly to S5/human.
